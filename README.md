# Autocomplete Company Extension
This extension is a simple example of how to use autocomplete with jQuery UI in a Chrome extension. It allows you to search for a company and check if it's in a predefined list of companies. If the company is in the list, a "The company is in the list" message will appear. If it's not in the list, a "The company is not in the list" message will appear. Additionally, it will also display a random gif of a cat.
